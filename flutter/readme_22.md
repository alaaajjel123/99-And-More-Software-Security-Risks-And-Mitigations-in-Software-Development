# Buy_From_Me

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, a mobile application designed to help users browse and purchase products directly from vendors. The app is built using **Flutter** for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android). The development team worked tirelessly to ensure smooth user interactions and a seamless experience. After rigorous testing and optimization, the app was deployed to production, and users began downloading it from the App Store and Google Play.

Everything seemed perfect. The app was performing well, users were enjoying the experience, and the team celebrated their success. But then...

## 🚨 The Trauma: Strange Complaints and a Growing Nightmare

### Stage 1: Unusual User Reports
Users started reporting strange issues:

- Some users noticed that their accounts were being accessed without authentication.
- Others reported that their personal and payment information was exposed to unauthorized access.

The team investigated the app's behavior but found no immediate issues. Local tests worked flawlessly, and the app's authentication and payment integrations seemed secure. The problem persisted intermittently, and the team initially dismissed it as user error or phishing attempts.

### Stage 2: Escalating Security Concerns
Reports escalated. Some users claimed their payment details were compromised, and vendors reported unauthorized API usage. This was alarming—it wasn't just a bug; it was a potential security vulnerability. The team realized this wasn't a coding error but a malicious exploitation of their app's sensitive data.

## 🛑 The Vulnerability: WebView Cache Hijacking

The team discovered that the app had a critical security flaw: it allowed **WebView cache hijacking**, enabling attackers to extract sensitive data from the app’s WebView cache. Here's how it happened:

### 🔴 The Mistake:
- During development, the team did not disable WebView caching for sensitive data.
- The app stored authentication tokens, session cookies, and other sensitive information in the WebView cache.

### ⚠️ The Exploit:
- A malicious app on the user’s device accessed the WebView cache folder and retrieved sensitive information.
- Attackers used the extracted credentials to log into user accounts without authentication, retrieve payment and personal information, and conduct transactions on behalf of the user.

## ✅ The Lesson: Secure Handling of WebView Cache

To prevent this vulnerability, follow these best practices:

### 🔒 Disable WebView Caching for Sensitive Data:
Modify WebView settings to disable persistent caching:

```dart
WebView(
  initialUrl: 'https://www.buyfromme.com',
  javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.disabled,
  onWebViewCreated: (controller) {
    controller.clearCache();
    controller.runJavascript("document.cookie = \"\";");
  },
)
```

### 🖥️ Enforce Secure Storage for Authentication Tokens:
Use **Flutter Secure Storage** to store session tokens instead of WebView storage:

```dart
final secureStorage = FlutterSecureStorage();
await secureStorage.write(key: "session_token", value: token);
```

### 🛡️ Clear Cache on Logout and Exit:
Ensure all sensitive data is wiped when the user logs out:

```dart
await webViewController.clearCache();
await webViewController.runJavascript("document.cookie = \"\";");
```

### 🔀 Restrict Access to WebView Storage:
- Implement **Scoped Storage** to prevent unauthorized apps from accessing WebView cache.
- Use **EncryptedSharedPreferences** or **SecureStorage** for sensitive data.

### 🔍 Disable JavaScript Execution Where Not Needed:
Reduce attack surface by disabling JavaScript unless explicitly required:

```dart
WebView(
  javascriptMode: JavascriptMode.disabled,
)
```

### 📢 Educate Users on App Permissions:
- Encourage users to be cautious when granting storage and WebView access permissions to third-party apps.
- Implement permission monitoring tools to detect and alert users about excessive permissions requested by installed apps.

### 📚 Monitor and Log Anomalies:
- Log user session activities and detect abnormal login patterns.
- Implement alerts for session hijacking attempts.
