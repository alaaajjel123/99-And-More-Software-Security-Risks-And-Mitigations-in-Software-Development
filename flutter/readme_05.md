# Buy_From_Me

## "Buy_From_Me" E-Commerce App
Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, a seamless mobile platform for discovering and purchasing products, managing your shopping cart, and making secure transactions—all designed with **Flutter** for a smooth and responsive experience.

In the app, users can:
- Browse various product categories
- Update their profiles
- Make transactions using secure payment systems

However, behind the scenes, sensitive business logic is integrated into the app’s code. This intricate system can also be a target for attackers.

## Discovery of Sensitive Data Exposure
### Stage 1: Unusual Activity on the Backend
A few weeks after the release, the backend team notices unusual activity:
- **Suspicious spikes** in API requests and user actions that do not align with normal usage patterns.
- Suspected **compromise of business logic** related to discounts, pricing, and user behavior.
- A **possible security bypass** allowing unauthorized access.

### Stage 2: A Hacker’s Discovery
A security expert is hired to conduct penetration testing. During the test, they reverse-engineer the app’s code and uncover:
- **Sensitive API keys** for payment systems stored in plain text.
- **Critical business logic** for discounts and pricing, easily accessible.
- **Unauthorized discount application** and direct access to backend APIs leading to fraudulent purchases.

### Stage 3: Investigation Findings
Upon investigation, it is discovered that:
- The app’s **code was not obfuscated** in release builds.
- Attackers **decompiled the app** and extracted sensitive information.
- Business logic and API calls were **visible in plain text**, making exploitation straightforward.

## The Vulnerability: Reverse Engineering and Lack of Code Obfuscation
Reverse engineering involves decompiling an app’s binary to inspect and modify its code. Without **code obfuscation**, attackers can:
- **Extract Sensitive Information:** API keys, authentication secrets, and business logic.
- **Manipulate App Behavior:** Bypass features like pricing and authentication.
- **Discover Security Flaws:** Exploit vulnerabilities like hardcoded credentials and weak encryption.

### The Exploit: How Attackers Reverse-Engineered the App
#### 1. Decompiling the App
Attackers use tools like:
- **APKTool**, **JD-GUI**, or **JADX** to transform the app back into readable code.
- Gain access to code handling **payment processing, authentication, and pricing.**

#### 2. Extracting Sensitive Information
- API keys hardcoded into the app’s source code are exposed.
- Discount and pricing rules are easily accessible.

#### 3. Modifying App Behavior
- Attackers manipulate prices and discounts for **unauthorized purchases.**
- Gain access to user accounts **without proper authentication.**

## The Lesson: Secure Code Obfuscation Practices
To protect **Buy_From_Me** from reverse engineering attacks, implement **best security practices:**

### 1. Enable Code Obfuscation
Flutter provides a built-in mechanism for obfuscation. Always enable obfuscation in release builds:
```bash
flutter build apk --obfuscate --split-debug-info=/<path-to-output-dir>
flutter build ios --obfuscate --split-debug-info=/<path-to-output-dir>
```

### 2. Keep Sensitive Information Secure
- **Never hardcode sensitive data** (API keys, tokens, secrets).
- Store them securely on the **backend** and retrieve using **encrypted channels**.
- Use **FlutterSecureStorage** for secure device storage.

### 3. Use Strong Encryption
Encrypt sensitive data within the app:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';

final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();
await storage.write(key: 'apiKey', value: encryptedApiKey);
```

### 4. Obfuscate Business Logic
- Obfuscate critical **discount, pricing, and payment logic**.
- Keep critical calculations **on the server-side** instead of client-side.

### 5. Use Proguard for Android
Enable **Proguard** in `build.gradle` for further Android code obfuscation:
```gradle
buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```

### 6. Conduct Penetration Testing & Audits
- Regularly conduct **penetration testing** and **security audits**.
- Work with security experts to assess vulnerabilities.

### 7. Secure the App Store
- Submit the app to **Google Play & Apple App Store**, ensuring compliance with their security policies.

## Conclusion
Reverse engineering poses **serious security risks** for mobile applications. Without **proper code obfuscation**, attackers can easily decompile the app, extract sensitive data, and manipulate its behavior.

By implementing **code obfuscation techniques** and following **best security practices**, you can significantly reduce the risk of reverse-engineering attacks and **protect your app and user data**.

**Stay secure and keep your code safe from prying eyes!**
