# Buy_From_Me

Buy_From_Me is a dynamic mobile e-commerce platform where users can browse products, manage their shopping carts, and make secure transactions with ease. Built with Flutter, the app promises a seamless experience from product selection to payment.

In the app, users can register, log in, and make secure purchases using payment gateways. The development team worked tirelessly to ensure the app was secure and functional. After rigorous testing, the app was deployed to production, and everything seemed perfect. Users were enjoying the seamless experience, and the team celebrated their success.

## The Trauma: A Breach in Security

### Stage 1: A Breach in the Payment Process
A few weeks after launch, a fraudulent transaction was detected in the system. An unauthorized user managed to make a purchase using a stored credit card without any additional authentication.

#### Investigation Findings:
- Biometric authentication was not enabled for sensitive actions like login or payment.
- The device was already unlocked by the user, and no further verification was required for making sensitive operations, such as checkout.
- This opened up a potential attack vector where an attacker could perform sensitive actions without needing the userâ€™s biometric verification.

### Stage 2: The Investigation Reveals the Issue
Further investigation showed that the app lacked an additional layer of security for sensitive operations. Once the userâ€™s device was unlocked, no further biometric check was performed for actions like making a purchase or changing account details. This left the app vulnerable to attacks if someone gained access to an unlocked device.

## The Vulnerability: No Biometric Authentication for Sensitive Operations

Biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition) provides an additional layer of security for sensitive operations on mobile devices. Without it, if the device is unlocked, attackers can perform sensitive actions, such as logging in or making payments, without additional verification.

### Vulnerable Actions:
- Making a purchase
- Changing account details
- Viewing order history
- Managing payment methods

This left the app vulnerable to attacks if someone gained access to an unlocked device and performed critical operations without any biometric validation.

## The Exploit: How Attackers Could Bypass Authentication

### **Step 1: Unlocked Device**
- The attacker gained access to the device, which was either left unattended or unlocked.
- The device was already logged into the Buy_From_Me app (the attacker had access to the user's phone or had cracked the phoneâ€™s lock screen).

### **Step 2: Performing Sensitive Actions**
- The attacker opened the app and was able to add items to the cart and complete a payment without being required to authenticate via biometric checks.
- No fingerprint or facial recognition was asked for at any point during sensitive operations like checkout or account management.

### **Step 3: Unauthorized Transactions**
- The attacker completed the transaction, potentially draining the userâ€™s payment method or stealing sensitive data without the userâ€™s consent.

### **Step 4: No Audit Trail**
- Since biometric authentication was not enabled, there was no way to track whether the legitimate user or someone else performed the transaction.

## The Lesson: Secure Sensitive Operations with Biometric Authentication

Without proper biometric authentication for critical operations, sensitive actions such as login, payment, and account management are at risk. Implementing biometric authentication mitigates this risk by requiring users to provide fingerprint or face recognition verification before allowing these operations.

For Buy_From_Me, biometric authentication should be integrated for all sensitive operations, ensuring that only the legitimate user can perform these actions.

## Mitigation Steps: Implementing Biometric Authentication

The best way to secure sensitive operations is to implement biometric authentication using the `local_auth` Flutter package. This will prompt users for fingerprint or face recognition verification before performing any critical actions, even if the device is unlocked.

### **Integrating Local Authentication**

#### **1. Add the local_auth dependency**
```yaml
dependencies:
  local_auth: ^2.0.0
```

#### **2. Import the package**
```dart
import 'package:local_auth/local_auth.dart';
```

#### **3. Initialize Local Authentication**
```dart
LocalAuthentication auth = LocalAuthentication();
```

#### **4. Check for Biometric Support**
```dart
bool canCheckBiometrics = await auth.canCheckBiometrics;
bool isDeviceSupported = await auth.isDeviceSupported();
```

#### **5. Authenticate the User**
```dart
bool authenticated = false;
try {
  authenticated = await auth.authenticate(
    localizedReason: 'Please authenticate to complete this action',
    biometricOnly: true, // Optional: Only use biometrics
    useErrorDialogs: true,
    stickyAuth: true,
  );
} catch (e) {
  print(e);
}

if (authenticated) {
  // Proceed with the sensitive operation
} else {
  // Handle authentication failure (e.g., prompt again or show error)
}
```

#### **6. Example: Securing Payment with Biometric Authentication**
```dart
void makePayment() async {
  bool isAuthenticated = await authenticateForPayment();
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    // Proceed with payment
    processPayment();
  } else {
    // Show an error or ask for alternative authentication
    showError('Authentication failed.');
  }
}

Future<bool> authenticateForPayment() async {
  bool authenticated = await auth.authenticate(
    localizedReason: 'Authenticate to proceed with payment',
    biometricOnly: true,
    useErrorDialogs: true,
    stickyAuth: true,
  );
  return authenticated;
}
```

## Additional Security Measures

### **Ensure Compatibility**
- Make sure the app works across different platforms (iOS and Android).
- Both platforms support biometric authentication, but the implementation details may vary.

### **Fallback Authentication**
- For users who cannot use biometric authentication, provide a fallback mechanism, such as a PIN or password, for critical operations.

### **User Education**
- Educate users on the importance of biometric authentication.
- Encourage them to enable fingerprint or face recognition on their devices for additional security.

## A Word of Caution

For attackers or anyone considering exploiting such vulnerabilities:
- **Hacking is illegal and unethical. If caught, you are subject to severe penalties.**
- **Every action leaves traces; you may be tracked and held accountable for your actions.**
- Instead, **use this knowledge to secure your applications and educate others.**

## Conclusion

Biometric authentication is a powerful tool for securing sensitive operations, such as payments and account management. By integrating fingerprint or facial recognition verification into the Buy_From_Me app, you ensure that only legitimate users can perform these actions, even if the device is unlocked. This additional layer of security is crucial in protecting your users and their data from unauthorized access and potential fraud.
