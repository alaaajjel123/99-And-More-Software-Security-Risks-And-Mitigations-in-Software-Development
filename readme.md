# ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹  Hello Team!

I'm glad to see you here. In this repo, I have attached over 99 security considerations in software development I've discovered and learned about during my time as a software engineer. These considerations are organized by different tech stacks: Next.js, SpringBoot, Angular, Flutter basically. Each of these security stories has been crafted to highlight real-world vulnerabilities, the strange behaviors that can occur in the development process, and how hackers exploit these issues.

## Whatâ€™s Inside This Repo?
In this repo, youâ€™ll find:

### **Detailed Security Considerations**
For each security consideration, Iâ€™ve included a security concern with an explanation, a real-world example of how itâ€™s been exploited, and practical guidance on how to mitigate it.

### **Stories & Scenarios**
Each security consideration is presented as a story. I believe that learning through real-life examples not only helps to understand the technical concepts better but also engages you with a more memorable experience.

### **Best Practices & Mitigation Strategies**
After every security story, Iâ€™ve included best practices to avoid falling into the same trap. Whether you're developing for Next.js, Angular, SpringBoot, or Flutter, these strategies will help you write more secure code and avoid common pitfalls.

### **Insights for Hackers**
I also provide insights for those curious about the mindset of attackers. Understanding how hackers think can help developers secure their applications better. In every story, youâ€™ll see how hackers exploit vulnerabilities and what they might target.

## Why This Repo?
In development phase as software engineers, we often get caught up in building new features and pushing code, but security is always something thatâ€™s overlooked until itâ€™s too late. This repo is here to help:

### **Identify Vulnerabilities Early**
Security threats evolve quickly, and understanding the vulnerabilities in your tech stack is the first step to mitigating risks.

### **Learn Through Stories**
Security doesnâ€™t have to be dry or boring. By reading through these stories, youâ€™ll not only learn about vulnerabilities but also understand why they are important and how to apply security best practices in your own work.

### **Enhance Your Defensive Skills**
As developers, the goal is to write secure code. But to do that, we need to think like a hacker. This repo will teach you how to think ahead and build defensively.

## The Tech Stacks Covered
A modern full-stack web framework for React that is increasingly popular but presents its own set of security challenges.
- **Angular**: A powerful front-end framework that often runs into vulnerabilities if not correctly configured.
- **SpringBoot**: A backend Java framework that is commonly targeted by attackers if insecure APIs or configurations are used.
- **Flutter**: A cross-platform mobile framework with specific security considerations to be mindful of in mobile apps.

Each security consideration is stack-specific, but the lessons are universal. Once you understand the principles here, you can apply them to other stacks as well. This repo is expandableâ€”as new stacks or vulnerabilities emerge, Iâ€™ll continue to add to it.

## How You Can Use This Repo
- **Developers**: If youâ€™re a developer, this repo is an essential read to keep your skills sharp and to avoid falling into common security traps.
- **Security Professionals**: If youâ€™re working in the security field or just starting, this is a great way to see the vulnerabilities from a developerâ€™s perspective.
- **Hackers & Enthusiasts**: Understanding security from the offensive side is essential to becoming a better developer. By understanding how exploits are carried out, youâ€™ll be better equipped to defend against them.

## Contributing
I believe that security is a community effort. If you have any additional security stories, vulnerabilities, or tips to share, feel free to fork this repo, add your contribution, and create a pull request.
