# Welcome to Buy_From_Me

An e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases seamlessly. The frontend is built with Angular, while the backend leverages the power of Spring Boot. One of the appâ€™s standout features is its advanced search functionality, which uses GraphQL to allow users to query products with complex filters like price range, category, and ratings. This feature was designed to provide a powerful and flexible search experience for users.

Everything seemed perfect. The system was secure, the APIs were performing well, and users were loving the experience. The development team celebrated their success as the user base grew rapidly. But then...

## The Trauma: Strange Search Results and Data Exposure

### Stage 1: Odd Search Behavior
Users started reporting strange behavior:

- Some users claimed their search results included unrelated products that didnâ€™t match their query.
- Others reported that their search queries returned no results, even though they knew the products existed.

At first, the team thought these were isolated incidents. However, as more users reported similar issues, it became clear that something was seriously wrong.

### Stage 2: The Investigation Begins
The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team reviewed the logs and found that the backend had received malformed GraphQL queries from the frontend. A developer manually tested the search functionality and discovered that the backend was not validating or sanitizing GraphQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious queries.

## The Vulnerability: Unauthorized Data Access via GraphQL Injection
The issue arose because:

- **Improper Query Validation:** The backend was not validating or sanitizing GraphQL queries, making it vulnerable to GraphQL Injection.
- **No Input Sanitization:** The app did not sanitize user inputs before processing them, allowing attackers to inject malicious queries.
- **Lack of Monitoring:** The team had not set up proper monitoring to detect unusual activity or malicious queries.

## The Exploit: How It Happened
An attacker sent a malicious GraphQL query to the backend API:

```graphql
query {
    products {
        name
        price
        users {
            email
            password
        }
    }
}
```

The backend executed the query, exposing sensitive user data. This led to:

- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive product and user information was exposed to unauthorized users.
- **Erosion of User Trust:** Users lost confidence in the app, and some stopped using it altogether.
- **Reputation Damage:** The appâ€™s reputation was harmed, and the team had to work hard to regain user confidence.

## The Lesson: Secure GraphQL Query Handling
To prevent this vulnerability, the team took the following steps:

### 1. Validate and Sanitize GraphQL Queries
The backend was updated to validate and sanitize all GraphQL queries before executing them. This ensured that even if attackers bypassed the frontend validation, their queries would be rejected by the backend.

#### Example (GraphQL Query Validation):
```java
public boolean validateQuery(String query) {
    // Use a library like graphql-java to validate the query
    return GraphQLValidator.isValid(query);
}
```

### 2. Implement Query Depth Limiting
The app was updated to limit the depth of GraphQL queries to prevent attackers from executing overly complex or resource-intensive queries.

#### Example (Query Depth Limiting):
```java
@Bean
public GraphQL graphQL() {
    return GraphQL.newGraphQL(schema)
        .maximumQueryDepth(10) // Limit query depth to 10
        .build();
}
```

### 3. Set Up Logging and Monitoring
The team implemented the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging. Alerts were configured to notify the team of any unusual activity or malicious queries.

#### Example (Logging Configuration):
```yaml
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework: ERROR
    com.buyfromme: DEBUG
```

### 4. Conduct a Security Audit
The team performed a thorough security audit to identify and fix other potential vulnerabilities. They used tools like OWASP ZAP and Snyk to scan the app for security issues.

### 5. Deploy the Fixed Version
The updated app was deployed to production, and users were notified of the improvements. The team also issued a public statement apologizing for the issue and explaining the steps taken to resolve it.

## Insights for Developers
To avoid similar issues, developers should:

- **Always Validate and Sanitize Queries:** Never trust user inputs. Always validate and sanitize GraphQL queries before executing them.
- **Implement Query Depth Limiting:** Limit the depth of GraphQL queries to prevent attackers from executing overly complex or resource-intensive queries.
- **Set Up Logging and Monitoring:** Monitor your app for unusual activity and respond quickly to incidents.
- **Conduct Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit your app for vulnerabilities and fix them promptly.
- **Follow Security Best Practices:** Stay informed about security best practices and apply them consistently.

## A Word of Caution
For hackers or anyone considering exploiting such vulnerabilities:

- **Hacking is illegal and unethical.** If caught, you are subject to severe penalties and will be considered as a criminal.
- **Every action leaves traces;** you may be tracked and held accountable for your actions.
- Instead, **use this knowledge to secure your applications and educate others.**

## Conclusion
The GraphQL Injection vulnerability in the "Buy_From_Me" app serves as a critical reminder: security lies in the details. Always assume an attacker is looking for weak spots and design your systems to withstand even the most creative attacks. By following secure practices and educating developers, we can build resilient, trustworthy applications.
