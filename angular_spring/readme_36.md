# Buy_From_Me:

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, an e-commerce platform that prides itself on innovation and user satisfaction. The app, built with **Angular** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend, recently introduced a **global content delivery network (CDN)**. This feature ensures fast and reliable access to the app for users around the world, providing a seamless shopping experience regardless of location.

The development team worked tirelessly to ensure the CDN was robust, scalable, and user-friendly. After rigorous testing, the feature was deployed to production, and users loved it. The app’s user base grew rapidly, and the team celebrated another successful release.

## 🚨 The Trauma: Strange Redirects and Suspicious Websites

### 🔹 Stage 1: Odd Redirects
Users began reporting strange behavior when trying to access **Buy_From_Me**:

- Some users were redirected to **unfamiliar websites** that looked similar to the app but asked for sensitive information like **login credentials and payment details**.
- Others reported being **unable to access** the app at all, receiving errors instead.

At first, the team dismissed these reports as **isolated incidents** or **user errors**. After all, the app’s infrastructure was robust, and no issues had been identified during development.

### 🔹 Stage 2: Credential Theft
Reports escalated. Some users reported **unauthorized access** to their accounts after entering their credentials on these suspicious websites.

This was no longer a minor issue—it was a **security crisis**. The team realized that the **global CDN**, a feature designed to enhance user experience, had become a gateway for attackers.

## 🔥 The Vulnerability: DNS Cache Poisoning
DNS is a critical component of internet infrastructure, but it must be secured properly. Here’s how the vulnerability was exploited:

### 🔸 DNS Cache Poisoning:
- The app was using an **unsecured DNS resolver** that did not validate the authenticity of DNS responses.
- Attackers exploited this by **injecting malicious DNS records** into the cache, redirecting users to fake websites.

### 🔸 The Exploit:
- When a user tried to access `buyfromme.com`, the **poisoned DNS cache** redirected them to a malicious website.
- The **fake website mimicked the app’s design**, tricking users into entering their credentials and payment details.

#### 🕵️ Example of the Exploit:
```plaintext
1. Attacker poisons the DNS cache with a fake record for `buyfromme.com`.
2. User tries to access `buyfromme.com` and is redirected to the attacker’s website.
3. User enters their credentials, which are then stolen by the attacker.
```

## 🔐 The Lesson: Securing DNS Configurations
To prevent such vulnerabilities, follow these **best practices**:

### ✅ Use a Secure DNS Resolver:
Ensure your app uses a **secure DNS resolver** that validates the authenticity of DNS responses.

Example configuration:
```plaintext
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

### ✅ Implement DNSSEC:
Use **DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)** to ensure the authenticity and integrity of DNS responses.

Example configuration:
```plaintext
dnssec-enable yes;
dnssec-validation yes;
dnssec-lookaside auto;
```

### ✅ Monitor DNS Records:
Set up monitoring to **detect changes** in DNS records and **unauthorized DNS responses**.

Example configuration for DNS monitoring:
```yaml
monitoring:
  dns:
    enabled: true
    interval: 5m
    alerts:
      - type: unauthorized_change
        recipients: security-team@buyfromme.com
```

### ✅ Educate Users:
Warn users about **phishing attempts** and encourage them to **report suspicious websites or redirects**.
