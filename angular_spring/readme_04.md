# "Buy_From_Me"

## üìñ Overview
The application **"Buy_From_Me"** is built with an Angular frontend, providing seamless interaction for users browsing and purchasing items. Recently, the app faced intermittent outages, where users reported it being inaccessible during peak usage times. These issues seemed random but were eventually traced back to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting the frontend layer.

This README provides insight into the DDoS attack scenario, how it affected the application, the steps taken to identify the vulnerability, and measures for prevention.

## üö® Problem Description

### Symptoms Observed:
- Users reported intermittent app unavailability during busy periods.
- The development team, upon monitoring the frontend, found unusual traffic spikes originating from multiple IPs worldwide.
- Despite no visible breaches in the backend, the frontend consistently struggled with performance during these attacks.

### Technical Context:
- The app's frontend is an Angular-based single-page application (SPA).
- Angular handles dynamic content updates and user interaction via REST APIs, making it vulnerable when bombarded with simultaneous requests.

### The attack leveraged the following weaknesses:
- No rate-limiting or request throttling implemented.
- The static assets of the Angular app (e.g., `main.js`, `styles.css`) were being requested repeatedly by bots.
- Lack of bot detection or IP filtering at the frontend delivery layer.

## üéØ Understanding the Attack

### Attack Vector:
- A botnet generated massive amounts of GET requests for frontend static assets (`index.html`, `main.js`, `styles.css`).
- The requests came from diverse IP addresses, making them appear legitimate at first glance.

### Impact:
- Angular‚Äôs frontend framework struggled to handle the volume of requests.
- The CDN (Content Delivery Network) or hosting server, unable to differentiate between legitimate users and bots, served these requests until resources were depleted.

### Why It Happened:
- **No Rate Limiting**: The app did not restrict the number of requests an individual client could send within a certain timeframe.
- **No CAPTCHA or Bot Protection**: There were no mechanisms to distinguish real users from bots during periods of high traffic.
- **No WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: A firewall capable of filtering malicious traffic was absent.

## üîç Investigation and Findings

### Monitoring Tools:
- Traffic analysis showed a sudden influx of requests to the app‚Äôs `index.html` and other static assets, with most requests originating from unfamiliar regions.

### Key Findings:
- The attack originated from a botnet with globally distributed IP addresses.
- Requests targeted the Angular frontend‚Äôs static files, exhausting server resources and causing legitimate user requests to fail.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implementation

### 1. Immediate Mitigation:
- **Blocked Malicious IPs**: Identified and temporarily blocked the IP ranges sending suspicious traffic using server-level rules.
- **Reduced Session Timeout**: Limited active user sessions to reduce load on the server.
- **Implemented CDN-Level Rate Limiting**: Partnered with a CDN to enforce request throttling and IP filtering.

### 2. Long-Term Fixes:

#### Frontend Improvements:
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented Angular‚Äôs lazy loading to optimize the app‚Äôs static assets and reduce the number of files served to the browser.
- **Content Delivery Optimization**: Configured caching headers to minimize repeated requests for unchanged assets.

#### Backend and Hosting Layer:
- **Rate Limiting**: Configured rate limiting at the server level to reject requests exceeding a predefined threshold.
- **WAF Integration**: Deployed a Web Application Firewall to detect and block suspicious traffic patterns.

#### Bot Detection:
- Added CAPTCHA mechanisms for non-authenticated users.
- Deployed bot detection scripts to analyze user behavior and differentiate between legitimate users and automated bots.

#### Traffic Monitoring:
- Set up real-time monitoring tools like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, or Azure Front Door to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks before they escalate.

#### Secure Headers:
- Added `Content-Security-Policy` and `Strict-Transport-Security` headers to reduce the risk of abuse.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Recommendations

### Development Practices:
- Avoid using wildcard `*` for CORS policies. Allow only trusted origins.
- Ensure static files are cached efficiently using cache-busting mechanisms.

### Monitoring and Alerts:
- Set up alerts for unusual spikes in traffic.
- Continuously review logs for patterns indicating bot traffic.

### User Awareness:
- Notify users about ongoing attacks during incidents via banners or emails.
- Encourage users to report app unavailability immediately.

### Testing:
- Conduct regular load testing to ensure the app can handle peak traffic.
- Simulate DDoS scenarios during testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## üö® Hacking Disclaimer
- If you are familiar with such attack scenarios, it is crucial to understand the ethical responsibilities associated with cybersecurity knowledge.
- Hacking is illegal and constitutes a violation of privacy and property rights.
- Engaging in malicious activities can lead to severe legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment.
- Instead of exploiting vulnerabilities, contribute by reporting them responsibly to the concerned teams and organizations.
