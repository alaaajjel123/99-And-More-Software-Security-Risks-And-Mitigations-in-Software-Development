# Buy_From_Me

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, an e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases seamlessly. The frontend is built with **Angular**, while the backend leverages the power of **Spring Boot**. One of the appâ€™s most praised features is its **user-generated content (UGC) system**, which allows users to upload images and documents to personalize their profiles and listings. This feature was designed to enhance user engagement and provide a more personalized shopping experience.

Everything seems perfect. The system is secure, the APIs are performing well, and users are loving the experience. The development team celebrates their success as the user base grows rapidly. But then...

## Strange Feedback and a Growing Nightmare

### Stage 1: Unauthorized Access to Private Files
Users start reporting strange behavior:

- Some users claim their private images and documents are being accessed by other users.
- Others report that their files have been modified or deleted without their consent.

The team investigates the issue, checking the file storage system and access logs. Initially, they suspect user error or isolated incidents. However, the problem persists, and the complaints grow louder.

### Stage 2: Files Shared Without Consent
Reports escalate. Users are now reporting that their private files are being shared on social media without their permission. This is alarmingâ€”it's not just a bug; it's a **potential security vulnerability**. The team realizes this isn't a coding error but a **malicious exploitation of their file storage system**.

## The Vulnerability: Exploiting Insecure File Permissions

After a thorough investigation, the team discovers that the appâ€™s file storage system is using **insecure file permissions**. Here's how it happened:

### The Issue:
- **File Storage System**: The app allows users to upload files, which are stored on the server. However, the file permissions were not properly configured, leaving them accessible to unauthorized users.

### The Exploit:
- An attacker exploited the insecure file permissions to access and modify private files. For example:
  - The attacker accessed Sarahâ€™s private images and shared them on social media without her consent.
  - Other usersâ€™ documents were modified or deleted without their knowledge.

### The Impact:
- **Unauthorized users could access and modify private files**, leading to **data breaches**.
- **Users lost trust in the app**, and some even stopped using it due to security concerns.
- The appâ€™s **reputation was damaged**, and the team had to work hard to regain user confidence.

## The Lesson: Securing File Permissions and Access Control

To prevent this vulnerability, follow these **best practices**:

### 1. Implement Secure File Permissions
Ensure that your appâ€™s file storage system uses **secure file permissions** to prevent unauthorized access.

```bash
chmod 600 /path/to/private/files
```

### 2. Implement Access Control
Use **access control mechanisms** to restrict access to private files.

```yaml
access-control:
  enabled: true
  roles:
    - role: USER
      permissions: [READ, WRITE]
    - role: ADMIN
      permissions: [READ, WRITE, DELETE]
```

### 3. Set Up File Integrity Checks
Implement **file integrity checks** to detect unauthorized modifications to files.

```yaml
file-integrity:
  enabled: true
  checksum-algorithm: SHA-256
  alerts:
    - type: unauthorized_modification
      recipients: security-team@buyfromme.com
```

### 4. Monitor and Log
Log unusual behavior and monitor file access to **identify potential attacks early**.

### 5. Stay Informed
Keep up with the **latest security vulnerabilities** and best practices for file storage and access control.

## A Word of Caution
For hackers or anyone considering exploiting such vulnerabilities:

- **Hacking is illegal and unethical**. If caught, you are subject to **severe penalties** and will be considered a **criminal**.
- **Every action leaves traces**; you may be tracked and held **accountable** for your actions.
- Instead, use this knowledge to **secure your applications and educate others**.

## Conclusion
The **Insecure File Permissions** vulnerability serves as a **critical reminder**: **security lies in the details**. Always assume an attacker is looking for weak spots and design your systems to withstand even the most creative attacks. By following **secure practices** and educating developers, we can build **resilient, trustworthy applications**.
