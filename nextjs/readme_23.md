# Buy_From_Me

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, an interactive e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and complete transactions in real-time. The frontend is built with **Next.js** for Server-Side Rendering (SSR), ensuring fast page loads and SEO optimization, while the backend leverages the power of **Spring Boot** to handle business logic and authentication.

## The Nightmare: Strange Feedback and a Growing Issue

### Stage 1: Odd Transaction Behavior
Users start reporting strange behavior:
- **Incorrect inventory levels**: Users claim that items are shown as available but are out of stock when they try to purchase them.
- **Double purchases**: Some users report that they’ve been charged twice for the same order.

The team investigates the logic between the frontend and backend but finds no apparent issue. Local tests work flawlessly. The problem persists intermittently, and the team dismisses it as a network latency issue.

### Stage 2: Security Incident – Unauthorized Cart Changes
Reports escalate. Some users claim that their cart contents were changed without their action. This is alarming—it's not a simple bug; it's a potential security vulnerability. The team realizes this isn't a coding error but a **malicious exploitation of their transaction system**.

## The Vulnerability: Exploiting Race Conditions in SSR
Race conditions are powerful and stealthy when exploited correctly. A subtle misstep in synchronization can open the door to devastating attacks. Here's how:

### **Concurrent Requests**:
1. The user submits multiple requests to the server, such as adding items to their cart or initiating a purchase.
2. The server processes these requests asynchronously but doesn’t ensure proper sequencing.

### **The Exploit**:
An attacker takes advantage of this by sending multiple requests in quick succession, potentially altering the final response.
- They could trick the server into updating inventory or prices before a transaction is finalized.

### **The Impact**:
- **Data Manipulation**: The attacker can manipulate data, such as inventory levels or user cart contents, leading to incorrect transactions or double purchases.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure**: A race condition could expose user session tokens, payment details, or other sensitive information through timing discrepancies.

## Preventing Race Condition Exploits in SSR

### **1. Synchronized Asynchronous Operations**
Ensure that critical operations (e.g., updating inventory, processing payments) are executed sequentially or with a locking mechanism to prevent interference from concurrent requests.

```javascript
const processTransaction = async (cartItems) => {
  try {
    // Step 1: Validate inventory
    await validateInventory(cartItems);
    
    // Step 2: Process payment
    const paymentResult = await processPayment(cartItems);
    
    // Step 3: Update order status
    await updateOrderStatus(paymentResult);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing transaction:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### **2. Transaction Isolation for Critical Data**
Use transactions to ensure that changes are atomic and rollback changes if any part of the transaction fails.

```javascript
const updateInventory = async (productId, quantity) => {
  const transaction = await db.beginTransaction();
  try {
    // Lock inventory record for this product
    await db.query('SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE product_id = ?', [productId]);
    
    // Update inventory
    await db.query('UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - ? WHERE product_id = ?', [quantity, productId]);
    
    // Commit transaction
    await transaction.commit();
  } catch (error) {
    await transaction.rollback();
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### **3. Use Rate Limiting and Debouncing**
Implement rate limiting or debouncing to prevent multiple requests from being submitted too quickly.

```javascript
const rateLimiter = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimiter({
  windowMs: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per window
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/checkout', limiter);
```

### **4. Atomicity for Concurrent Requests**
Use atomic database operations to update multiple parts of your application in a way that prevents any intermediate failures.

```javascript
await db.query('UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = ? AND quantity > 0', [productId]);
```

### **5. Monitor and Log**
Log unusual transaction behaviors and authentication failures to detect potential attacks early.

## ⚠️ A Word of Caution
For hackers or anyone considering exploiting such vulnerabilities:
- **Hacking is illegal and unethical.** If caught, you are subject to severe penalties and legal consequences.
- **Every action leaves traces.** Security teams and forensic tools can track and hold you accountable.

Instead, use this knowledge to **secure applications and educate developers**.

## Conclusion
The **Race Condition** vulnerability serves as a critical reminder: **security lies in the details**. Always assume an attacker is looking for weak spots and design your systems to withstand even the most creative attacks.

By following secure practices and educating developers, we can build resilient, trustworthy applications.
