# "Buy_From_Me"

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, an e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases seamlessly. The frontend is built with Next.js, while the backend is powered by a robust Node.js API. 

The platform has been running smoothly, attracting more users every day. The development team is proud of the system's performance and scalability. Everything is going wellâ€”until suddenly, the system starts experiencing major slowdowns and downtime.

## The Crisis: Unexpected Traffic Surge

### Stage 1: Slow Website Performance
- Users report that pages are taking a long time to load.
- Product search results take forever to display.
- Some users are completely unable to check out, leading to frustration and abandoned carts.

### Stage 2: Server Overload & Downtime
- The team notices unusual spikes in server requests.
- The backend CPU and memory usage are at their limits.
- Eventually, the site goes completely down, affecting all users.

At first, the team thinks it's just an unexpected surge in legitimate users, but the pattern is suspicious. Upon deeper investigation, they realize that **Buy_From_Me** is under a **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack**.

## The Vulnerability: Exploiting Open Endpoints

### How the Attack Worked:
1. Attackers identified an open, unauthenticated API endpoint, such as the product search API, that did not have request limits.
2. Using a botnet, they flooded the API with thousands of requests per second.
3. The massive number of requests overwhelmed the server, causing legitimate users to be unable to access the app.
4. Since the attack was distributed across many IP addresses, simple IP-based blocking was ineffective.

This attack severely impacted business operations, leading to revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.

## The Solution: Protecting Against DDoS Attacks

To prevent future DDoS attacks, the team implemented the following measures:

### 1. **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling**
- Set up API rate limits to restrict the number of requests per minute from each IP address.
- Example configuration using Express.js middleware:
    ```javascript
    const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
    const limiter = rateLimit({
        windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
        max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per window
        message: "Too many requests, please try again later."
    });
    app.use('/api/', limiter);
    ```

### 2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- Deployed a WAF to filter and block suspicious traffic automatically.
- Cloudflare, AWS Shield, or Fastly were considered for mitigating such attacks.

### 3. **CAPTCHA on Key Endpoints**
- Added CAPTCHA to product search and checkout endpoints to prevent automated abuse.
- Google reCAPTCHA integration was added to prevent bot traffic.

### 4. **Traffic Monitoring & Anomaly Detection**
- Set up real-time monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana to detect unusual traffic spikes.
- Implemented automated alerts when API request volumes exceed expected thresholds.

### 5. **CDN Protection**
- Implemented a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to absorb malicious traffic before it reaches the server.

### 6. **IP and ASN Blocking**
- Identified attack sources and blocked entire ASN (Autonomous System Numbers) ranges used by botnets.
- Blacklisted malicious IPs dynamically using fail2ban.

### 7. **Scaling & Load Balancing**
- Distributed traffic across multiple instances using load balancers to absorb traffic spikes.
- Automatically scaled backend resources during high traffic periods.

## Conclusion
A **DDoS attack** can bring an entire business down if not handled correctly. **Buy_From_Me** learned a crucial lesson about proactive security measures. With rate limiting, WAF, CAPTCHA, traffic monitoring, and scaling strategies in place, the app is now more resilient against future attacks.

By staying vigilant and continuously improving security, full-stack developers can ensure their applications remain robust and available even in the face of aggressive cyber threats.
