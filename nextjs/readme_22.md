# Buy_From_Me

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, an e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases seamlessly. The frontend is built with **Next.js**, while the backend leverages the power of **Spring Boot** to handle business logic and authentication. Our app uses **WebSockets** for real-time updates, such as live inventory status and cart updates, providing users with a smooth and interactive experience.

Everything seems perfect. The system is secure, the APIs are performing well, and users are loving the experience. The development team celebrates their success as the user base grows rapidly. But then...

## The Trauma: Strange Feedback and a Growing Nightmare

### Stage 1: Odd Real-Time Behavior
Users start reporting strange behavior:

- **Real-time updates not working**: Users claim that changes to their cart or inventory status are not reflected in real-time.
- **Unexpected cart changes**: Some users report that items are added or removed from their cart without their action.

The team investigates the logic between the frontend and backend but finds no apparent issue. Local tests work flawlessly. The problem persists intermittently, and the team dismisses it as a network latency issue.

### Stage 2: Security Incident – Unauthorized Cart Changes
Reports escalate. Some users claim that their cart contents were changed without their action. This is alarming—it's not a simple bug; it's a **potential security vulnerability**. The team realizes this isn't a coding error but a **malicious exploitation of their real-time communication system**.

## The Vulnerability: Exploiting Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)

WebSockets are powerful and flexible when implemented correctly. However, a subtle misstep in security configurations can open the door to devastating attacks. Here's how:

### **WebSocket Connection:**
- A legitimate WebSocket connection is established between the user's browser and the **Buy_From_Me** server, allowing for real-time interactions.
- The connection might not be properly secured (**e.g., using `ws://` instead of `wss://`**).

### **The Exploit:**
- An attacker tricks the user into loading a malicious script (**e.g., through phishing, social engineering, or cross-site scripting (XSS)**).
- The malicious script intercepts and **takes over the WebSocket connection**.
- The attacker can then steal **authentication tokens or cookies** sent over the WebSocket, allowing them to impersonate the legitimate user or take unauthorized actions on their behalf.

### **The Impact:**
- **Session Hijacking**: The attacker gains access to the user’s session, potentially performing actions like adding or removing items from the cart.
- **Unauthorized Transactions**: The attacker may gain unauthorized access to the user’s cart or order history, leading to fraudulent transactions or data theft.

## The Lesson: Preventing Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)
To prevent this vulnerability, follow these best practices:

### 1. **Use Secure WebSocket (`wss://`)**
Ensure that WebSocket connections are encrypted using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** by using `wss://` instead of `ws://`.

#### Example configuration in Next.js:
```javascript
const server = require('http').createServer(handler);
const io = require('socket.io')(server, {
  // Enable secure WebSockets
  transports: ['websocket'],
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on wss://localhost:3000');
});
```

### 2. **Authenticate WebSocket Connections**
Verify the user’s identity before allowing WebSocket communication.
Use secure authentication tokens (**e.g., JWT**) in the WebSocket handshake (sent as headers).

#### Example:
```javascript
io.use((socket, next) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.headers['authorization'];
  if (token && verifyJWT(token)) {
    next();
  } else {
    next(new Error('Authentication error'));
  }
});
```

### 3. **Implement Same-Origin Policy and Origin Header Validation**
Validate the `Origin` header in the WebSocket handshake to ensure that only trusted origins are allowed to establish WebSocket connections.

#### Example:
```javascript
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  const origin = socket.request.headers.origin;
  if (origin !== 'https://yourtrusteddomain.com') {
    socket.disconnect(true);
  }
});
```

### 4. **Use Subprotocols for Additional Security**
Define and require a specific subprotocol when initiating the WebSocket connection.

#### Example:
```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://yourserver.com', ['protocol1', 'protocol2']);
```

### 5. **Implement Expiration/Timeouts for WebSocket Connections**
Set timeout mechanisms to ensure that WebSocket connections don’t remain open for extended periods.

#### Example:
```javascript
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  setTimeout(() => socket.disconnect(true), 30 * 60 * 1000);  // 30 minutes
});
```

### 6. **Monitor and Log**
Log unusual WebSocket connections and authentication failures to detect potential attacks early.

## A Word of Caution ⚠️
For hackers or anyone considering exploiting such vulnerabilities:

- **Hacking is illegal and unethical.** If caught, you are subject to severe penalties and will be held accountable for your actions.
- **Every action leaves traces**; you may be tracked and held accountable for your actions.
- Instead, **use this knowledge to secure your applications** and educate others.

## Conclusion
The **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)** vulnerability serves as a critical reminder: **security lies in the details**. Always assume an attacker is looking for weak spots and design your systems to withstand even the most creative attacks. By following **secure practices** and **educating developers**, we can build resilient, trustworthy applications.
