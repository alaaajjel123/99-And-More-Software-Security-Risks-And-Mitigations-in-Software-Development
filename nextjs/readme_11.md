# Scenario: The "Buy_From_Me" E-Commerce App
Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, an e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases seamlessly. The frontend is built with Next.js, while the backend is powered by a high-performance API.

Everything seems perfect. The system is secure, the APIs are performing well, and users are loving the experience. The development team celebrates their success as the user base grows rapidly.

But then...

## The Incident: Unexplained Service Degradations
### Stage 1: Unexpected Slowdowns
Users start reporting that the website becomes **unresponsive at random times**. Some pages take forever to load, while others **time out completely**. 

The team investigates but finds no significant infrastructure issues. CPU, memory, and database usage appear normal.

### Stage 2: Backend Overload
Further monitoring reveals that the API is receiving **an abnormally high number of requests** from certain IP addresses. These aren’t full-fledged DDoS attacks but **bursts of requests** coming from individual users in a short time frame.

Certain power users—or possibly bots—are spamming endpoints like:
- **Product search**
- **Cart updates**
- **Checkout requests**

This is not just a performance issue; it's a **security loophole**.

## The Vulnerability: Lack of Dynamic Rate Limiting
Traditional rate limiting applies a fixed threshold, like **100 requests per minute per user**. However, this doesn’t account for:
- **Legitimate traffic spikes** from real users during sales events.
- **Attackers slowly ramping up traffic** to stay under static limits.
- **VIP users needing more access** without being blocked.

In **Buy_From_Me**, the fixed rate limit was ineffective because attackers could operate **just below the threshold**. Once they understood the system's static limits, they **exploited predictable gaps** to flood endpoints.

---

## The Fix: Implementing Dynamic Rate Limiting
To prevent such abuse, the team implemented **adaptive rate limiting**, which adjusts based on traffic patterns and user behavior.

### 1. Using a Weighted Rate Limiting Algorithm
Instead of a **flat request-per-minute limit**, we applied a **token-bucket approach** where:
- **Heavy API requests (e.g., checkout, payment verification)** consume more tokens.
- **Light requests (e.g., product search)** consume fewer tokens.
- The system refills tokens at a dynamic rate based on normal user behavior.

### 2. Implementing Progressive Penalties
When a user/bot exceeds normal thresholds:
- First, they receive **increased response delays** instead of outright blocking.
- If the pattern continues, **their rate limit is reduced dynamically**.
- Persistent abuse leads to **temporary bans with alerts** to administrators.

### 3. Integrating with Edge Networks
To prevent botnets from bypassing our backend limits, we leveraged **CDN-level rate limiting**:
- Cloudflare/Akamai API Gateway inspects traffic **before it reaches our server**.
- High-frequency requests from the same source are **throttled at the edge**.
- Legitimate bursts (e.g., from a trending product) are allowed **based on behavioral analytics**.

### 4. Logging and Monitoring
- Integrated **real-time dashboards** in Grafana/Kibana to track anomalies.
- Alerted security engineers **when suspicious traffic patterns emerge**.
- Added logs to **correlate frontend behaviors with backend request surges**.

## Conclusion
By moving beyond **static rate limiting** and implementing **dynamic, context-aware controls**, we prevented both accidental and malicious abuse of our APIs.

Rate limiting is **not just a performance safeguard**—it is a **critical security measure**. Adaptive rate limits ensure real users have a smooth experience while keeping attackers and bots at bay.
