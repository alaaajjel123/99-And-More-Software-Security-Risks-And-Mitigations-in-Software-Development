# Buy_From_Me

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, a vibrant e-commerce platform where customers can browse products, make secure transactions, and interact with a modern, responsive web interface. The frontend is built with **Next.js**, while the backend leverages the power of **Spring Boot** to handle business logic and authentication. Our app is designed to provide a seamless and secure shopping experience for users.

Everything seems perfect. The system is secure, the APIs are performing well, and users are loving the experience. The development team celebrates their success as the user base grows rapidly. But then...

## Strange Feedback and a Growing Nightmare

### Stage 1: Odd User Experience
Users start reporting strange behavior:

- **Buttons not working as expected**: Users claim that clicking certain buttons (e.g., "Add to Cart" or "Checkout") doesnâ€™t perform the expected action.
- **Unexpected purchases**: Some users report that theyâ€™ve made purchases without intending to.

The team investigates the logic between the frontend and backend but finds no apparent issue. Local tests work flawlessly. The problem persists intermittently, and the team dismisses it as user error.

### Stage 2: Malicious Intent Discovered
Reports escalate. Some users claim that their account settings were changed without their action. This is alarmingâ€”it's not a simple bug; it's a potential security vulnerability. The team realizes this isn't a coding error but a **malicious exploitation** of their user interface.

## The Vulnerability: Exploiting Clickjacking

Clickjacking is a powerful and stealthy attack when executed correctly. However, a subtle misstep in security configurations can open the door to devastating attacks. Here's how:

### Invisible iframe Attack

1. **The attacker embeds an invisible iframe** over a legitimate button on the Buy_From_Me app, such as the "Add to Cart" or "Checkout" button.
2. **The user thinks they are clicking the visible button**, but their click actually triggers the malicious iframe.
3. **The malicious iframe performs an unauthorized action**, such as completing a purchase or changing settings in the userâ€™s account.

### The Exploit:

- The attacker places the Buy_From_Me page inside an **invisible iframe** on their malicious site.
- They overlay a **fake button** over the genuine "Confirm Purchase" button, tricking the user into clicking the wrong action.
- Once clicked, the user unknowingly submits a purchase or triggers a sensitive action like changing their payment information.

## The Lesson: Preventing Clickjacking Attacks

To prevent this vulnerability, follow these best practices:

### 1. Set X-Frame-Options Header

The **X-Frame-Options** HTTP header instructs browsers to prevent your website from being embedded within an iframe.

#### Example configuration in Next.js:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'X-Frame-Options',
            value: 'SAMEORIGIN', // or 'DENY' if stricter protection is needed
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

### 2. Set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) Header

The **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)** header allows you to specify where resources can be loaded from.

#### Example configuration in Next.js:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
            value: "frame-ancestors 'self';",
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

### 3. Use Framebusting JavaScript (Optional)

Implement **framebusting JavaScript** to detect if your page is being displayed inside an iframe and prevent it.

#### Example code:

```javascript
if (window.top !== window.self) {
  window.top.location = window.self.location;
}
```

### 4. Monitor and Log

- Log unusual user interactions and authentication failures to detect potential attacks early.

## A Word of Caution

For hackers or anyone considering exploiting such vulnerabilities:

- **Hacking is illegal and unethical**. If caught, you are subject to severe penalties and will be held accountable for your actions.
- **Every action leaves traces**; you may be tracked and held accountable for your actions.
- **Instead, use this knowledge to secure your applications and educate others.**

## Conclusion

The Clickjacking vulnerability serves as a critical reminder: **security lies in the details**. Always assume an attacker is looking for weak spots and design your systems to withstand even the most creative attacks. By following secure practices and educating developers, we can build **resilient, trustworthy applications**.

**Keep learning, stay curious, and stay secure!**

### Happy Coding, and Secure Your Apps! ðŸš€
