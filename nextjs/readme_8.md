# "Buy_From_Me"
Welcome back to **Buy_From_Me**, our e-commerce platform where users seamlessly browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases. The application is built using **Next.js** as a full-stack framework with a **Node.js backend** and a **PostgreSQL database**.

The team has ensured security by implementing authentication via OAuth2, proper data sanitization, and other best practices. The app is running smoothly, and the business is growing.

However, a new issue arises...

---

## The Incident: Website Becomes Unusable
### Stage 1: A Sudden Surge in Traffic
One day, the development team starts receiving complaints from customers:
- "I keep getting errors when trying to log in!"
- "The website takes forever to load!"
- "I was in the middle of checkout, and it just crashed!"

Initially, the team suspects a server outage. They check the **server logs**, but everything appears to be functioning correctly—no crashes, no database failures.

### Stage 2: Unexpectedly High API Usage
Further investigation into the **server logs** and **network requests** reveals something unusual:
- **Tens of thousands of requests** are being made every second to critical API endpoints.
- The **login endpoint** and **checkout endpoint** are being flooded with requests from unknown sources.
- The **database CPU usage** has spiked, affecting legitimate users.

It turns out the app is suffering from an **API rate-limiting vulnerability**!

---

## The Vulnerability: Lack of Proper Rate-Limiting
APIs often expose endpoints that allow users to perform actions such as logging in, checking out, or retrieving product information. Without proper rate-limiting, an attacker (or even an automated script) can **spam these endpoints** with requests, leading to:
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading the server, making it unavailable for legitimate users.
- **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Rapidly testing stolen usernames and passwords.
- **Abusive API Consumption:** Scraping product data or placing multiple fraudulent orders.

### Example Attack
Consider an attacker writing a simple script to overload the login endpoint:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    fetch('https://buyfromme.com/api/login', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ email: `user${i}@test.com`, password: 'password123' })
    });
}
```
This will rapidly send login requests, overwhelming the server and causing it to slow down or crash.

---

## The Solution: Implementing Rate-Limiting
To prevent this issue, **rate-limiting** should be applied to critical API endpoints. Here’s how:

### 1. **Using a Middleware for Rate-Limiting**
A simple way to enforce rate limits is by using a middleware like **express-rate-limit** in a Next.js/Node.js backend:
```javascript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 login attempts per window
    message: 'Too many login attempts from this IP, please try again later.',
    headers: true
});

app.post('/api/login', loginLimiter, (req, res) => {
    // Authentication logic
});
```
This ensures that each IP can only attempt **5 login requests per 15 minutes**.

### 2. **Rate-Limiting at the CDN or Proxy Level**
A more scalable approach is to use a **CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS WAF) or an API Gateway**:
- **Cloudflare Rate Limiting:**
  - Block or challenge excessive requests to specific endpoints.
  - Prevent bot attacks with CAPTCHA.
- **AWS API Gateway Throttling:**
  - Define per-user or per-IP request limits at the cloud level.
  
### 3. **Dynamic Rate-Limiting with User-Based Limits**
Instead of limiting by IP alone, use **user-based rate-limiting**:
```javascript
const userLimiter = rateLimit({
    keyGenerator: (req) => req.user?.id || req.ip, // Rate-limit per user ID
    windowMs: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
    max: 10, // 10 requests per window
    message: 'Too many requests. Please slow down!'
});
app.use('/api/checkout', userLimiter);
```
This prevents **logged-in users** from abusing APIs while still allowing a fair number of requests per session.

### 4. **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Monitor API request logs** using tools like **Grafana** or **ELK Stack**.
- **Detect unusual spikes** and automatically block abusive IPs.
- **Implement alerts** when a threshold is exceeded.

## The Lesson: Always Enforce Rate-Limiting
Without proper rate-limiting, attackers and bots can **overload your servers**, **bypass authentication protections**, or **exploit your API** for scraping or fraudulent activities. Implementing **IP-based, user-based, and behavioral rate-limiting** is essential for a secure, scalable web application.

By following these security practices, **Buy_From_Me** ensures a stable and secure experience for all users.

## Conclusion
Rate-limiting is not just about **preventing brute force attacks**; it is essential for **API stability and security**. With proper rate limits:
- **Servers remain responsive** even under high traffic.
- **Brute force login attempts are blocked.**
- **Abusive API access is mitigated.**

Always assume attackers are looking for vulnerabilities—implementing robust security measures is the best defense!
