# Buy_From_Me

Welcome to **Buy_From_Me**, an e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases seamlessly. The frontend is built with **Next.js**, while the backend leverages the power of **Node.js** and **Express**. The app uses **RESTful APIs** to handle user interactions, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

Everything seems perfect. The system is secure, the APIs are performing well, and users are loving the experience. The development team celebrates their success as the user base grows rapidly. But then...

## The Trauma: Strange Feedback and a Growing Nightmare

### Stage 1: Odd User Behavior
Users start reporting strange behavior:

- Shopping carts are being modified without their input.
- Payment details are appearing in their accounts that they didnâ€™t add.

The team investigates the logic between the frontend and backend but finds no apparent issue. Local tests work flawlessly. The problem persists intermittently, and the team dismisses it as user error.

### Stage 2: Unauthorized Access?!
Reports escalate. Some users claim their personal information was accessed without their consent. This is alarmingâ€”it's not a simple bug; it's a potential security vulnerability. The team realizes this isn't a coding error but a malicious exploitation of their API system.

## The Vulnerability: Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)
APIs are powerful and secure when implemented correctly. However, a subtle misstep can open the door to devastating attacks. Here's how:

### API Structure:
The app uses **RESTful APIs** to serve JSON data to the frontend. These APIs handle sensitive information like user profiles, shopping cart contents, and payment details.

### The Exploit:

1. An attacker injects a malicious script into a third-party website that points to one of Buy_From_Me's API endpoints.
2. The script retrieves sensitive JSON data from the API, exploiting the lack of proper **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** policies and authentication checks.
3. The attacker gains access to sensitive user data, including personal information and payment details.

#### Example of a malicious script:

```html
<script src="https://buyfromme.com/api/user/data"></script>
```

### The Impact:
- Sensitive user data is exfiltrated to the attacker's server.
- Users' personal information and payment details are compromised, leading to potential fraud and identity theft.

## The Lesson: Securing APIs Against XSSI
To prevent this vulnerability, follow these best practices:

### Implement Strict CORS Policies
Ensure that only trusted domains can make cross-origin requests to your APIs.

#### Example configuration in Express:
```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: 'https://buyfromme.com', // Only allow Buy_From_Me's domain
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
  credentials: true, // Allow credentials to be included in requests
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

### Authenticate API Requests
Ensure that all sensitive APIs require proper authentication mechanisms, such as **OAuth** or **JWT tokens**.

#### Example code:
```javascript
app.get('/user/data', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
  // Only authenticated users can access this endpoint
  res.json(userData);
});
```

### Set Content-Type Headers Properly
Always set the correct **Content-Type** header for your API responses, especially when sending JSON data.

#### Example:
```javascript
app.get('/user/data', (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  res.json(userData);
});
```

### Sanitize User Input and Prevent Script Injection
Use libraries like **DOMPurify** to sanitize any dynamic data or input that is rendered on the page.

#### Example:
```javascript
const DOMPurify = require('dompurify');
const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### Avoid Exposing Sensitive Data
- Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed via publicly accessible endpoints.
- Review API responses to ensure they do not inadvertently expose sensitive details.

## A Word of Caution
For hackers or anyone considering exploiting such vulnerabilities:

- **Hacking is illegal and unethical.** If caught, you are subject to severe penalties and will be considered as a victim.
- **Every action leaves traces;** you may be tracked and held accountable for your actions.
- Instead, **use this knowledge to secure your applications and educate others.**

## Conclusion
The **Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)** vulnerability serves as a critical reminder: security lies in the details. Always assume an attacker is looking for weak spots and design your systems to withstand even the most creative attacks. By following secure practices and educating developers, we can build resilient, trustworthy applications.

Keep learning, stay curious, and **stay secure!**

**Happy Coding, and Secure Your Apps!** ðŸš€
